## Development


To get started -

1. Ensure that you have a recent LTS version of Node.js, for development purposes [Node >= 16](https://nodejs.org/en/) is recommended.
2. Ensure that you have a recent version of Yarn, for development purposes [Yarn >= 1.22](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install) is required.
3. Install the dependencies by running `yarn`
4. Ready! Now you can launch the UI (assuming you have a local Polkadot Node running), via `yarn run start`
5. Access the UI via [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
